# Covid-Networks-Outreach
Used to reach to cities across the nation in search of volunteer opportunities for the Covid Networks Organization.
Covid Networks brings volunteers and seniors together to prevent isolation of seniors. Mainly in senior homes.

# WARNING
  - ILLEGAL FOR COMMERCIAL USE UNDER THE CAN-SPAM ACT
    - Please check https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/2007/11/canspam.pdf

- Use of this program was for volunteering purposes only and has no relations to commerce
- I only scrape city-council sites 
- Emails will only be sent once to one recipient. Hence there is no need for unsubscribe
- Non-automatic email responses will be read and if needed replied to
- Email database used only to make sure that one person only gets one email and document progress
- Past and future updates will continue to make sure that emails are only sent to those within the jurisdiction of our volunteering opportunity
- Will not scrape social media or send emails to non-gov't addresses

# Updates
- screen url against common urls so you don't start crawling social media
- ignore emails with certain words in them, prevents unessecary emails
- ignore link if too long when scraping
- add multiprocessing to scraping
- make scraping save more ram by saving partial links
- reformat email_sender such that it sends by the city with a max of 297 emails

# Future
- Support for robots.txt
- Create better output when scraping (output is a mess to read)
