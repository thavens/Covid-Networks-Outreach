# Covid-Networks-Outreach
Used to reach to cities across the nation in search of volunteer opportunities for the Covid Networks Organization.
Covid Networks brings volunteers and seniors together to prevent isolation of seniors. Mainly in senior homes.

# WARNING
  - ILLEGAL FOR COMMERCIAL USE UNDER THE CAN-SPAM ACT
    - Please check https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/2007/11/canspam.pdf

- Use of this program was for volunteering purposes only and has no relations to commerce
- We have many constraints that constrain emails to only those within the justdiction of what we are doing and those who would be interested
    - We only send targeted emails and do not harvest links from social medias or wikipedia
    - Those emailed will only every recieve one email unless there is a reply
      - All non-automatic replies are read and responded to if required

# Updates
- screen url against common urls so you don't start crawling social media
- ignore emails with certain words in them, prevents unessecary emails
- ignore link if too long when scraping
- add multiprocessing to scraping
- make scraping save more ram by saving partial links
- reformat email_sender such that it sends by the city with a max of 297 emails

# Future
- Support for robots.txt
- Create better output when scraping (output is a mess to read)
