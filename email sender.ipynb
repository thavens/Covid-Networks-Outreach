    "Regarding our organization, we have designed a free virtual service where senior citizens can request to hold online video sessions one-on-one with students and other young citizens. In addition, we prepare fun events and activities for seniors that will help them find a community during this pandemic. These include interactive yoga meditation sessions, book clubs, trivia/online games, live music performances and artwork sessions, and more! We are currently a 501-c national nonprofit recognized by the government. Our 750+ volunteers have worked with over 6200 seniors and 52 senior centers!\n",

Our work has been featured by prominent local news platforms, including KCBS, SF Examiner, and The Mercury News.\n",

We would like to partner with the city of {city} as we believe that we can make a tangible impact in the community with our passionate volunteers, and hope to have your support in our outreach efforts. Check out more information on our website at https://www.covidnetworks.org, and feel free to reach out to us for further questions and information.\n",
